### TUTORIAL

# bpy.data important fields: objects, scenes, materials

# hovering over buttons shows the command they relate to. e.g.
# bpy.data.objects["Cube"].location[0]
# Also pressing Ctrl-C while hovering copies command to the clipboard

# add/remove data: use methods of data collections
# mesh = bpy.data.meshes.new(name="MyMesh")
# bpy.data.meshes.remove(mesh)

# custom properties: are saved in the blender files and must be of type
# int,float,string (or arrays of), and dicts of type {str: int/float/str}

# opposed to global operations, the CONTEXT corresponds to active/visible
# elements. It is mainly read-only, can only be modified through the API
# C.scene.objects.active = obj  # instead of bpy.context.object = obj

# Operators are tools generally accessed by the user from buttons, menu items
# or key shortcuts. See help-> operator cheat sheet. Many operators are
# constrained to specific context. The best way to check this from Python is:
#     if bpy.ops.view3d.render_border.poll():
#         bpy.ops.view3d.render_border()
# **NOTE: operators are tricky to work with, see for more details:
#         https://docs.blender.org/api/blender2.8/info_gotcha.html

# reload script without reloading blender:
#    import myscript
#    import importlib
#    importlib.reload(myscript)
#    myscript.main()

# use a different Python (different approaches)
# see docs.blender.org/api/blender2.8/info_tips_and_tricks.html
# section drop-into-a-python-interpreter-in-your-script
# * remove the blender/python directory, blender will default to your own
#   (versions must match)
# * append context to sys.path
# * use blender as module (requires rebuilding Blender)


# drawing during script: DISCOURAGED but possible. See
# https://docs.blender.org/api/blender2.8/info_gotcha.html

# Edit mode: it is important to note that edit mode has its own data which is
# only written back when exiting edit-mode. The easiest way around this is to
# have the script check/report edit mode and execute only outside edit mode.
#    py.ops.object.mode_set(mode="EDIT")
#    modes supported by cube: "OBJECT", "EDIT", "SCULPT", "VERTEX_PAINT",
#                             "WEIGHT_PAINT", "TEXTURE_PAINT".
# References have to be reassigned after entering and exiting edit mode:
#    mesh = bpy.context.active_object.data
#    polygons = mesh.polygons
#    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='EDIT')
#    # ...
#    bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode='OBJECT')
#    # polygons have been re-allocated
#    polygons = mesh.polygons
#    print(polygons)

# bones, pose, armature: EditBones (in edit mode) and Bones (otherwise) can
# be accessed and manipulated with the API. Just make sure to clearly separate
# the code in edit mode from the other modes. PoseBone instances contain
# strictly speaking the armature status rather than bones. Used for animations.
# see https://docs.blender.org/api/blender2.8/info_gotcha.html

# data names: may be altered if empty string, to long, already existing...
# Its better practice not to reference objects by names at all, rather work
# with the references in datastructures.

# Library collisions: try to avoid them. Still, there is a mechanism to
# differentiate between local and library data:
#    # typical name lookup, could be local or library.
#    obj = bpy.data.objects["my_obj"]
#    # library object name look up using a pair where the second argument
#    # is the library path matching bpy.types.Library.filepath
#    obj = bpy.data.objects["my_obj", "//my_lib.blend"]
#    # local object name look up using a pair
#    # where the second argument excludes library data from being returned.
#    obj = bpy.data.objects["my_obj", None]
#    # both the examples above also works for 'get'
#    obj = bpy.data.objects.get(("my_obj", None))


# Multithreading: So far, no work towards thread-safety for python scripts
# has been done, so better avoid. And in any case, make sure the threads
# finish before the script. Enforce that by always using join()

# Undo/redo: invalidates all bpy.types.ID instances (Object, Scene, Mesh,
# Lampâ€¦ etc). Try it: cube = C.objects["Cube"] gets invalidated after undo.
# Avoid interactive usage while holding references!

# Remove: The API allows for profilactic deleting of non-used data via
# the remove() method. Deleted references throw exception instead of crashing.
#    mesh = bpy.data.meshes.new(name="MyMesh")
#    bpy.data.meshes.remove(mesh)

# sys.exit() may exit Blender and look like a crash! try to avoid. Some
# libraries, like argparse, sys.exit when invalid arguments. Workaround
# see https://docs.blender.org/api/blender2.8/info_gotcha.html
